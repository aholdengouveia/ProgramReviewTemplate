NECHE Standard 4.3 Programs leading to degrees or other awards have a coherent design and are characterized by appropriate breadth, depth, continuity, sequential progression, and synthesis of learning.


A. Describe the curriculum, and discuss how it is an organized, sequential series of courses that progress from simple to complex learning. (You may use the same format used in the NECC Academic Catalog.)

Include discussion of the mechanisms that allow input into these processes from (1) employers of program graduates and (2) schools to which students transfer (if applicable).
