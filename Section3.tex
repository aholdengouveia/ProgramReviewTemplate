SECTION III: PROGRAM POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

NECHE Standard 4.3 Programs leading to degrees or other awards have a cohort design… coherence is demonstrated through…policies and procedures for admission, retention, and completion.



A. List any specific program policies and procedures, and comment on the rationale for any differences from institutional policies and procedures.

(Programs may need to develop specific policies and procedures related to the day-to-day operation of the specific program [e.g., to establish the parameters for clinical education experiences]. When there are specific program policies and procedures, these policies and procedures should be consistent with those of the institution. Differences between program-specific policies and institutional policies should be described within the context of the program.)






B. Describe what the program does to assure that all students in the program receive copies of current program-specific policies and procedures, relevant information about the program, and information about the institutional policies and procedures.








C. Describe how the program defines “student success.” (For example, if the program facilitates student transfer, and students do indeed transfer, does this meet the program’s definition of success?)
